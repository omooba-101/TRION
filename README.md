 👋 Hi there Mechanical Engineering Student | Simulation & CAD | Solar & Hybrid System Design | Front-End Web Developer

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a passionate Mechanical Engineering student with strong technical skills in simulation, design, and prototyping, as well as front-end web development. I enjoy creating innovative engineering solutions, working on renewable energy system designs, and combining software tools with real-world applications.

My work focuses on:
- 💡 Simulation & Modeling — using tools like ANSYS, MATLAB/Simulink, MSC Adams, and PVsyst.
- 🏗️ Technical Drafting & CAD Design — with AutoCAD, SolidWorks, CATIA, and SketchUp.
- ☀️ Solar PV & Hybrid System Design — including HelioScope and HOMER Pro for feasibility studies.
- 🖥️ Web Development — building interactive projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


 🧭 Objective
To apply engineering principles and technical innovation to solve real-world problems through design, analysis, and technology. My goal is to build efficient, sustainable, and intelligent solutions that bridge traditional mechanical engineering with modern digital tools.
